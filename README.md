# StudyBuddy.io

## Inspiration
As university students, we often felt the lack of meaningful feedback in our learning journey. This inspired us to create an AI-powered platform that empowers students with free, instant access to detailed insights and progress tracking. Our goal is to help learners grow, improve, and become better every day.

## What It Does
- **Exam Analysis:** Upload graded exam PDFs and leverage LLM models like ChatGPT, LLAMA, and more to generate detailed feedback on strengths, weak topics, and actionable next steps.
- **Dynamic Mini Tests:** Generate dynamic, time-based mini tests for quick practice on topics of your choice using LLM technologies.
- **Progress Tracking:** Efficiently track progress and improvement based on your performance in graded exams.

## What's Next for StudyBuddy.io
- Successfully integrate the feedback and data extraction pipelines to our website and deploy.
- Expand the platform by integrating additional models and features.
